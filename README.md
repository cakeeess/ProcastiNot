# 🧠 ProcastiNot — Your Friendly Anti-Procrastination Buddy

Welcome to **ProcastiNot** — a minimalist, clean, and *slightly bossy* to-do list app that helps you stop procrastinating and start dominating 🐝💼

Built with:
- ⚛️ React + Vite
- 💨 Tailwind CSS
- ✨ shadcn/ui
- 💾 LocalStorage (for those who like their tasks remembered)

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add, remove, and complete tasks
- 📆 Track deleted tasks date-wise (so you don’t forget what you were avoiding)
- 🌙 Dark mode ready (because we all procrastinate at night)
- 🔥 Clean and responsive UI with shadcn components
- 💻 Offline-friendly (like your attention span)

---
