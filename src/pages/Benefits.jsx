          About the App
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Procrastinot</strong> is a minimal yet powerful to-do list app designed to help you organize tasks, stay focused, and actually beat procrastination (get it? ðŸ‘€). With a sleek UI, subtle gradients, and smooth animations, itâ€™s more than just a list â€” itâ€™s your daily productivity companion.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The app is built using <strong>React</strong> and styled with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. It uses <strong>custom hooks</strong> to cleanly manage task state, timestamps, and local storage â€” giving it a scalable and maintainable architecture. New tasks, completed tasks, and their respective creation/completion times are all automatically tracked and displayed.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          With real-time day, date, and time shown on the homepage, itâ€™s easy to stay anchored to your day. Each task includes options to mark as complete or delete, with smooth entry/exit animations for better UX.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The typography is carefully selected to reflect a calm yet modern aesthetic. All headers and text use a clean cyan-to-teal color palette that fits the calming gradient theme of the app.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Whether youâ€™re jotting down quick ideas or planning your week, <strong>Procrastinot</strong> is made to support your flow â€” not interrupt it.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-sm italic text-gray-500">
          Stay productive. Stay inspired. Stay not-procrastinating âœ¨
        </p>
